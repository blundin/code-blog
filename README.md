## What is this?
This is the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) project and data for my blog. It's posted here for backup, and in hopes someone finds it useful.

## What I'm using
The site is powered by Jekyll, with [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) as a responsive framework. I am not using plugins to manage Foundation, but instead I am using Grunt to build, and Bower to manage dependencies. Eventually I want to clean this up, but it works for now.
