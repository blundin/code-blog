A timely solution to a real problem:

>“I have read and agree to the Terms” is the biggest lie on the web. We aim to fix that.

We need better answers to the legalese and archaic approaches to license agreements and terms of service. This is a big deal.

More:

>Terms of service are often too long to read, but it's important to understand what's in them. Your rights online depend on them. We hope that our ratings can help you get informed about your rights. Do not hesitate to click on a service below, to have more details! You can also get the ratings directly in your browser by installing our web browser add-on

Convinced. Browser extension installed.
