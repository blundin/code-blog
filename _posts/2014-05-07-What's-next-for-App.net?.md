Manton Reece on [the recent App.net announcement](http://blog.app.net/2014/05/06/app-net-state-of-the-union/):

> There’s no shame in shooting for the stars and missing. I’m thankful that even as the founders tried a few things outside micro-blogging over the last year, they never compromised on their original mission for the service. They never sold out users or developers, and the servers hum along in testament to that fact, as if nothing that’s good will ever really change. 

I agree with Manton. I'm glad they took a shot at redefining the model for social media platforms. I'm glad they stuck to their promises even when the numbers did not go the way they, and many of us, wanted them to. 

In the long-term, I don't think an advertising-centric business model will work for the social media players. Or, should I say I hope it doesn't.

Thanks [Dalton](https://alpha.app.net/dalton) and company for taking a run at this.
