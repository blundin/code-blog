I work in a company that has been paperless for two decades. At home we have a ton of devices, more than one for every use case. I had a Palm Pilot in college. I haven't sent a letter in the mail in over a decade. All of my to-dos and calendars are digital. And yet, I can't escape the analog world of pen and paper.

Of course, the truth is that I don't want to escape it. I love pens and paper. I love the feel of writing with a good pen. I love the physicality of a notebook. I carry a Field Notes book with me everywhere, every day. 

I'm completely stuck in between analog and digital. If I take notes digitally they are easy to find, and easy to copy and send to others. If I take them with pen and paper I remember them more easily, and I am prompted to act every time I open my current notebook.

I don't have a good solution to this problem. I don't know how to get the best of both worlds. And yes, I've googled this many, many times. I've spent hours of blogs of the similarly afflicted. I've found solutions that come close, particularly  archiving notebooks via photo in Evernote, but none of them have been practical for me.

So today I will go to work with my good pens and my notebook. I will sit down in my first meeting with my laptop open, and paper and pen beside it. I will continue living in between these worlds, because I don't have another option.
