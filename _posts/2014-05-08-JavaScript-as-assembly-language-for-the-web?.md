Scott Hanselman quotes Eric Meijer:
> JavaScript is an assembly language. The JavaScript + HTML generate is like a .NET assembly. The browser can execute it, but no human should really care whatâ€™s there.

Yeah, this feels right to me. I know many folks had problems with this observation and this post from Scott, but I think it's dead on.

Honestly, who likes plain JavaScript? Actually, since the advent of Prototype and jQuery, who even writes vanilla JavaScript? I bet the number is lower than you'd think. And there is a simple reason: like assembly was for early computers, the language is an efficient and effective language for the web, while being hard to read and hard to write.

I know, I know, hard is relative. I'm sure it might be easy for you because you've been writing it since 1996, but it's not that easy for everyone. And honestly, wouldn't you rather write in something like [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) instead? 

The beauty of new tools and language like CoffeeScript and its ilk is in the layers of abstraction and personal choice they offer for developers who still have to work with the universal scripting language of the web. Just like languages that compile to machine code, we are now compiling other languages into JavaScript. And I think that's a great thing.
