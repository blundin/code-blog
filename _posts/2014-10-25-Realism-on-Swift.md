>Swift has it’s warts. It’s a baby that’s trying to grow up quickly in a world that is harsh. The question I’ve been asking myself, both through these posts and throughout the weeks is really this: are Swift’s warts and ugly places worse than those of Objective C’s? Will they be tomorrow?

For the last week I've worked bit by bit on rewriting my first iOS app in Swift. Several years ago I wrote this app for my wife because she could not find a grade scale app on the App Store that was easy to use or not ugly. A few weeks later I installed this app on her phone, and she's been using it ever since.

When I first created the app it was for iOS 5. As the years have gone on I did a few things to keep it up to date, particularly for iOS 7, but I never moved to Auto Layout. With the launch of the iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, I decided it was time, and I figured I'd use Swift. Why not, right?

It's been a good exercise for me, and I'm learning to really like the language. I am more comfortable in Swift with my little bit of knowledge than I ever was in Objective-C, which I know far better. I enjoy it, but it's not perfect. That's why I appreciated this post from David Owens so much. It's not perfect, but it's what we've got.
