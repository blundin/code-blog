>If you attend an iOS/Mac dev meetup and hang around long enough, you’ll start to hear the whispers and the nervous laughter. There are people making merry in the midst of plenty, but each of them occasionally steps away to the edge of the room, straining to listen over the music, trying to hear the barbarians at the gates. There’s something wrong with the world, Neo.

Great read from Matt Gemmell.  I've been in this spot and gone back to development, I get where he is coming from. 

There is something on the horizon, although I don't know exactly what it is. There are so many changes afoot in the development world and in the industry that I don't think anyone can see very far down the road anymore. Developers have become a recognized asset in the broader world, yet it seems like there are lots of people who don't want to let that stand. The next decade will be fascinating.
