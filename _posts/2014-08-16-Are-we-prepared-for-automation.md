An automated world is closer than most of us realize.

This is the not Jetson's future I was promised, but that's okay. There is a problem though, as the video points out, in the economics.

When I talk about automation leading to efficiencies, I often frame it terms of freeing resources to do more interesting work. I still think that's true, but this video offers a great rebuttal. There will be people doing more interesting and innovative work than before, but not enough to head off potentially disastrous levels of unemployment.

I really appreciate the summary though, because the automated future is not necessarily bad, but it will be if we are not prepared. As someone who is pursuing automation right now, I must admit we need to spend more time thinking about how to better handle the challenges that will result.
