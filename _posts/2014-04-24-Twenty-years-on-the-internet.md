title: Twenty years on the internet

description: This blog is my newest contribution to the internet, founded with the goal of getting back to my first tech love, writing code. I will cover more ground than that of course, but my foucs is software, and other things software developers think about. My other blog covers my other loves, writing and storytelling, and I found that I couldn't touch on everything I wanted there, so I did what I love... fired up a text editor and started writing some HTML.

Twenty years ago I fell in love with the internet. I was a sophomore in high school, and only just beginning to figure out the social niceities that it takes to survive in that environment. The first PC in our home was a Packard Bell with a Pentium 75 MHz processor and some miniscule amount of RAM. It was not the fastest, even for the time, but it ran Castle Wolfenstein, Doom, Warcraft and Descent, so I was happy.

But when AOL opened up the internet to their users, I was fascinated by it. When AOL then opened up the internet to other browsers on your system I found Netscape Navigator, and then I really fell in love. It didn't take long until I realized that all those webpages listed in the Yahoo! web directory were ran by people. Not companies, not governments, but other people. And if they could have web pages, why couldn't I?

This realization lead me to Geocities, where I setup my first website. I think the free account had 2 MB of storage, which seemed massive to me. I mean, that was bigger than a floppy disc, and only games filled those up. I don't have any remnants of that first page, but I remember crafting it by hand. I learned HTML from library books, and I downloaded all the free web development and image tools I could find on the web. My first page, a Grateful Dead fan page, was the first "software" I wrote, and I loved it.

Since then I've lived on the web. I've had multiple blogs covering several different topics. I discovered the power of publishing. I discovered little corners and niches to explore. I stopped watching cable news in favor of my RSS feeds. I built my own sites. I built apps for my company. I learned almost every fashionable web development language and framework, and I became a web developer.

This blog is my newest contribution to the internet, founded with the goal of getting back to my first tech love, writing code. I will cover more ground than that of course, but my foucs is software, and other things software developers think about. [My other blog](http://brianlundin.com) covers my other loves, writing and storytelling, and I found that I couldn't touch on everything I wanted there, so I did what I love... fired up a text editor and started writing some HTML.
