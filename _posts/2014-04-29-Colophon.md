The colophon is set for a comeback. With so many new digital publishing options, platforms and approaches, there is a natural opening and call for sites to share how they do what they do. In the spirit of [the traditional colophon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)), I offer this summary of the tools behind this site.
