          <p>The settings in Quick Grades give you control over your experience and give you exactly the information you want, when you want it.</p>
          <p><strong>Screen Lock</strong>: Flipping this switch on will prevent your screen from dimming and the phone from locking as long as you are using the app. This is helpful while you are grading by keeping the screen active for your use. This can reduce your battery life while in use.</p>
          <p><strong>Decimal Places</strong>: This number sets the number of decimal places to show when calculating grade percentages.</p>
          <p><strong>Round up at</strong>: The settings specifies the decimal where the letter grade is rounded up. For example, if this value is set to '0.5' a 89.5% would be an 'A', and an 89.4% would be a B.</p>
          <h5>The following options control the visibility of each column:</h5>
          <p><strong>Missed Questions</strong>: The number of questions missed on the assignment being graded.</p>
          <p><strong>Correct Questions</strong>: The number correct out of the number possible.</p>
          <p><strong>Score</strong>: The calculated percentage for the given score.</p>
          <p><strong>Letter Grade</strong>: The calculated letter grade for the given score.</p>
